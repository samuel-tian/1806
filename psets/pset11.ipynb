    "**(a)** Write down a numerical formula for a possible real matrix $A$ such that $A$ is as small in size as possible and where $A$ contains no zero entries. Your formula can be left as a product of some matrices and/or matrix inverses — you don't need to multiply them out or invert any matrices, but you should give possible numeric values for all of the matrices in your formula.  (You don't need to explicitly check that your $A$ has no zero entries as long as zero entries seem unlikely. e.g. the inverse of a matrix with no special structure probably has no zero entries.  It wouldn't hurt to check in Julia, however.)\n",
