    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Recall the following definition of positive-definiteness: \"a hermitian $m\\times m$ matrix $M$ is positive-definite if for any non-zero complex $m$-vector $v$ we have $v^HMv>0$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A, B$ are positive-definite $m\\times m$ matrices, then for any non-zero vector $v\\in\\mathbb C^m$ we have $v^HAv>0$ and $v^HBv>0$. Hence $v^H(A+B)v=v^HAv+v^HBv>0$. Moreover $A+B$ is hermitian: $(A+B)^H=A^H+B^H=A+B$. Thus $A+B$ is positive definite. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** We can use the same definition as in part (a). $C^HBC$ is hermitian because $(C^HBC)^H=C^HB^HC=C^HBC$. Now assume that $v$ is a non-zero $n$-vector and consider $v^HC^HBCv$. Note that we can rewrite\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v^HC^HBCv=(Cv)^HB(Cv).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Since $C$ is full-column rank the nullspace $N(C)$ consists only of the vector $0$, so $Cv\\neq 0$. Hence, using that $B$ is positive-definite, we get $v^HC^HBCv=(Cv)^HB(Cv)>0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative solution of (b)** Recall another definition: \"a hermitian $m\\times m$ matrix $M$ is positive-definite if $M=A^HA$ for some matrix $A$ with full column rank\". Since $B$ is positive-definite $B=A^HA$ for some full column rank matrix $A$. Consequently we have $C^HBC=C^HA^HAC=(AC)^H(AC)$ and to show that $C^HBC$ is positive-definite it is enough to show that $AC$ is of full column rank. For the latter fact recall that being of full column rank is equivalent to having $0$ nullspace and we should show that $N(AC)=0$. But this follows from the fact that $N(A)=0$ and $N(C)=0$ ($A$ and $C$ are both of full column rank): if $ACy=0$ then $Cy=0$ since $N(A)=0$, which implies $y=0$ since $N(C)=0$."

Hence, applying part (b) of Problem 1 and using that $M^H=M$, we get that $-B$ is positive-definite."
