In class, a basis for $N(A)$ was the two special solutions $[-2,1,0,0]$ and $[-7,0,2,1]$ and from these how can you get a basis for $N(AP)$?  (Note: the problem gave the nullspace vector as $[-7,0,3,1]$, following a typo from the notes. You won't be penalized if you copy this and use 3 instead of 2 here.)"
