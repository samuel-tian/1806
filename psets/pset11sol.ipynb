For each of the following, say whether the ODE solutions at large times $t$ are expected to be **exponentially growing**, **exponentially decaying**, **oscillating forever**, or **approaching a nonzero constant**, for a randomly chosen initial condition $x(0)$.  Justify your answers.\n",

    "Recall that positive Markov matrices have one eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ and for all other eigenvalues, $|\\lambda|<1$. If a matrix is diagonalizable, looking at what happens to the eigenvectors is enough to characterize all solutions of the ODE. Also recall from lecture that \n",

    "\n",
    "$$x(t)= x_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t}c_1(0) + \\dots x_m e^{\\lambda_m t}c_m(0)$$\n",
    "where $x_1, \\dots, x_m$ are an eigenbasis for $A$, $\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_m$ are the corresponding eigenvalues, and the values $c_1(0), \\dots, c_m(0)$ are determined by the initial condition $x(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** The solution to this ODE has the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t)= x_1 e^{t}c_1(0) + \\dots x_m e^{\\lambda_m t}c_m(0)$$\n",
    "where $x_j, \\lambda_j$ are eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs for $M$ and we've used the fact that $\\lambda_1=1$. As $t \\to \\infty$, the first term will dominate the rest so the solution is **exponentially increasing as $t \\to \\infty$**. One way to see this is to write $\\lambda_j = a_j + i b_j$. Notice that $|\\lambda_j|^2 = a_j^2 + b_j^2<1$, so $a_j<1$ as well. Now, $e^{\\lambda_j t}= e^{a_j t} e^{i b_j t}$. Factoring $e^t$ out of the expression for $x(t)$, we get\n",
    "$$x(t)= e^t(x_1 c_1(0) + x_2 e^{(a_2 -1)t} e^{i b_2 t}c_2(0)+ \\dots x_m e^{(a_m -1)t} e^{i b_m t}c_m(0)).$$\n",
    "All of the terms except the first are decaying as $t \\to \\infty$ because $a_j -1 <0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** The solution to this ODE is **approaching a nonzero constant** $x_1 c_1(0)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Recall that the eigenvectors of $M-I$ are the same as the eigenvectors of $M$, and the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_j -1$. So the solution to this ODE is\n",

    "(This is almost exactly the same as the solution to the previous ODE, but we've subtracted $1$ from each eigenvalue, which is the same as multiplying the previous solution by $e^{-t}$.) As discussed above, $a_j-1<0$ for all $j$, so all terms but the first term decay as $t \\to \\infty$ and so the solution approaches $x_1 c_1(0)$. This vector is nonzero for random initial conditions $x(0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** The behavior of the solution to this ODE as $t \\to \\infty$ **can vary, depending on** $M$. The eigenvectors of $M^2 -M -I$ are the same as the eigenvectors of $M$ and the eigenvalues are $\\mu_j= \\lambda_j^2 - \\lambda_j -1$. Writing $\\lambda_j = a_j + i b_j$ as above, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mu_j=\\lambda_j^2 - \\lambda_j -1&= (a_j+ i b_j)^2 - a_j - ib_j -1\\\\\n",
    "&= (a_j^2 -b_j^2 - a_j -1) + i (2 a_j b_j - b_j).\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The real part of $\\mu_j$ might be negative or positive. For example, say $M$ has an eigenvalue of $-0.8$. Then \n",
    "$$a_j^2-a_j=1.44 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad b_j=1$$\n",
    "so $\\mathrm{Re}[\\mu_j]= 0.44$. In this instance, the solution of the ODE **exponentially increases** as $t \\to \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if $a_j>0$ (that is, if $\\lambda_j$ has positive real part), then $0<a_j<1$, so $a_j^2<a_j$ and $a_j^2-a_j<0$. In this situation, $\\mu_j$ has negative real part. So if all eigenvalues of $M$ have positive real parts, then all eigenvalues of $M^2-M-I$ have negative real parts and the solution **exponentially decays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if you have an eigenvalue of $a_j=0.5 - \\sqrt{1.25 + b_j^2}$ (from the quadratic formula), then $a_j^2 -b_j^2 - a_j -1 = 0$ and the solutions, assuming all of the other eigenvectors are decaying (except for the complex-conjugate eigenvalue $a_j - ib_j$), then the solution will either **oscillate forever** (if $b_j \\ne 0$, noting that $a_j^2 + b_j^2 < 1$ if $|b_j| \\lesssim 0.62481$) or go to a **nonzero constant** (if $b_j = a_j = 0$, i.e. if $M$ is singular by having e.g. two identical columns).\n"
