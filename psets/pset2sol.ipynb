    "1. As we are permuting the order of the rows, we should left multiply with $E$. The permutation matrix which reverses the rows is given by $E = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = EA$.\n",
    "2. We still want to perform the operation on rows, so we will left-multiply with $E$. We have to find an $E$ such that $E\\begin{pmatrix} R_1 \\\\ R_2 \\\\ R_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} R_1 \\\\ R_1+(R_3 + R_2) \\\\ R_3 + R_2 \\end{pmatrix}$. We can find $E = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = EA$.\n",
    "3. As we are performing the operation on columns, we want to multiply with $E$ on the right. We have to find an $E$ such that $\\begin{pmatrix} C_1 & C_2 & C_3 \\end{pmatrix}E = \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 - C_3 & C_2 - C_3 & C_3 \\end{pmatrix}$. We can find $E$ as $E = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $B = AE$."
